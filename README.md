- 👋 Hi, I’m @Axelgoris99
- 👀 I’m interested in mixed reality (both virtual and augmented), design (on every aspect of life), Unity, visualization or computer vision... everything in fact :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning human/computer interaction and mixed reality :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity visualization, VR/AR/MR UI/UX design or fullstack development. AI is of interest but I'm not an expert yet!
- 📫 How to reach me : agoriswork@gmail.com
